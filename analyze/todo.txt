next two weeks of testing 
June 9th 10th analysis done
scripts and figures
gives two weeks to write
how to formalize statistical tests ask KC

subject comments
    phonemic similarities difficult
    keeping eye location while listening at different locations is
    difficult
        talk about new Maddox paper eye gaze effects on auditory attention

email goals:
For each subject, individually averaging the "resting state"
pupil size and normalizing the trials for a subject by it.  I will
try this by using a global average to normalize or just average each
trial by the resting state before each trial.  This way we can see
if there is any large scale fluctuations for a subject throughout
the experiment that we may need to high pass filter out. Also
making a plot to average all trials for each subject, and then
all subjects to see if there is a clean exponential curve that
can be fit to get a tau for the ramp up times of each trial.

need to get a mean for each subject and condition
    for accuracy, for score, and for ps
finish score quickly
    then read kubler to do it correctly

NEXT STEPS
average all trials for each subject to look at dynamics
time trace for each block
average around target letters and replacments
