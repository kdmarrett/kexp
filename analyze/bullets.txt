General
-Primer times show no significant differences
-In general baseline correction by trial has lower p values 
-Task period (second through fifth cycles) yields lower p value
    than all including first cycle

Start vs. end (first 9 trials of exp. vs. last 9 trials)
-accuracy shows no sig. differences between start and end
-differences between fixed order and ps is exagerrated when
    examining early trials
-Fixed-order is significantly greater than Alphabetic
    and Random in early trials
-Across all trials only Fixed-order and Random are significantly different
-differences diminish in later trials
-in comparing global pupil means from start vs. end trials
    only fixed order showed a significant difference (.02)

Cycles
-Cycle 1 shows no significant differences across the board
-Whereas Cycle 2 shows sig differences as expected

Cognitive load
-WWL is an example manner for weighting different factors used in
the original NASA TLX study
-The values produced are very similar to the weighted and
unweighted values
-It will be used as the final strategy for the paper

Cross-measure validation
-Survey and Pupillometry are particularly correlated
-Fixed-order higher correlations
-Spearman better strategy than pearson due to relative nature

Discussion points:
-p < .05 or .10?
-In some cases non baseline corrected data shows more significant
    differences than baseline corrected.  This is the minority of
    cases and is considered random
-Rudimentary target interval testing shows a significant
    difference in mean value and maximum value in the interval after
    a target in the fixed order case.  However, when the mean of the
    condition is subtracted these differences are no longer
    significant. This suggests that local changes in pupil size, as
    in the interval after a target, may not be as discriminative as
    global changes for a task.

Takeaway
The difference between pupil size
