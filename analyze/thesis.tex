\begin{abstract}

    Attention mediated neural signals such as the P300
    response allow some patients with total loss of muscle
    control to communicate via a speller device.  Typically,
    P300 spellers rely on visual input.  However, due to the
    auditory system's unique capability of spatial selective
    attention of an auditory stream, new auditory speller
    paradigms that can aid a listener's ability to selectively
    listen may increase the bit rate of communication over the
    current standard and be more user-friendly.  In three
    conditions, alphabetic ordering, fixed ordering
    (non-alphabetic), and changing ordering, we examined the
    relative cognitive load via pupillometry and a subjective
    survey known as the NASA Task Load Index.  Native English
    speaker subjects (N=13) rated the alphabetic condition as
    less difficult than the fixed order presentation and
    random condition (p=.03, p=.005 respectively).
    Correlations were found between relative pupil size and
    subjective rating of cognitive load for the alphabetic and
    fixed-order conditions although not significant (p<.09,
    p<.08 respectively).  Relative pupil sizes showed that the
    fixed-order mean was greater than the random condition
    over the course of the task
    (p<.03), and in response to targets (p=.04). No
    significant differences or correlations were found for
    the subject's raw ability to attend to the letters among
    the three conditions. By combining objective and
    subjective measures of usability, this study offers a
    strategy for determining cognitive load for the end-user
    community of individuals who must rely on speller systems.

\section{Introduction and Background}
\subsection{Spatial selective attention} 
Humans have the ability in a crowded auditory environment to
selectively listen to different sounds and segregate different
sources into different \lq streams\rq (i.e. the \lq cocktail
party effect\rq) in what is known as auditory scene analysis
\cite{Bregman1994}. An auditory stream can be defined as a group of
successive or simultaneous sound elements that yield the percept of
a single object or source\cite{Moore2012}. These streams can be formed by
discriminating features such as spatial location or
temporal coherence and in general, the similarity and proximity of
sounds in sequence determines the perceived auditory streams in an
auditory environment\cite{Bregman1994}.  Listener's can consciously
shift attention among these elements, and this manner of selective attention 
has been shown to improve over time\cite{Best2008}.

\subsection{P300 Response} 
The P300 response is an event related
potential (ERP) characterized by a positive voltage deflection
around 300 ms after a rare or unexpected stimulus, and is typically recorded
using electroencephalography (EEG). In P300 tasks, a subject is
typically presented with a series of stimuli that fall into one of
two classes: target or non-target.  The target class must have lower
probability of occurring than the other. An auditory paradigm with
an oddball probability of 25\% is likely to yield a P300
response \cite{Nijboer2008}.  By selectively attending the stimuli, the subject
classifies the stimuli as target or non-target \cite{Wolpaw2012}.

P300 amplitude increases with increased absolute time gaps
between oddball presentation \cite{Gonsalvez2002}. 
Amplitude is also affected by moment to moment changes in the
probability that a stimulus will appear, where higher probabilities
result in diminished amplitude of responses
\cite{Donchin1981}.  Also, when users performed two tasks
simultaneously that elicited oddball responses, when one of
the tasks increased in difficulty and required more user
attention, the P300 amplitude associated with the more
difficult task had larger, more salient oddball responses
\cite{Sirevaag1989}. 

\subsection{Auditory P300 Spellers} 

ERPs such as the P300 response can be used for gauging user
intent in an auditory brain computer interface (BCI) device.
Leveraging the various characteristics of the P300 response,
the fundamental tradeoff for these systems is selections
presented and the accuracy of classifying the responses.  These
speller devices are typically used for patients with diseases
such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis when motor ability may
be so severely impaired that brain signals remain the last means
of communication\cite{Nijboer2008}.  Visual spellers are most
commonly used but due to the diversity in the population of
users (i.e.  blindness, eye-movement loss, eyelid-movement
loss) recent research has focused on replicating the
performance of visual P300 spellers in the auditory
domain\cite{Hohne2011}.  In addition, although the goal of
improving the raw rate at which information is transferred
(bit rate) of the P300 speller is a problem several decades
old, basic psychophysics research is still vital to carry out
in parallel with new advancements in classification methods.

Recent research has shown that even known ordering of stimuli can
produce classifiable responses.  In a new auditory speller known
as the \lq charStreamer \rq paradigm, letters are ordered
alphabetically \cite{Hohne2014}.  While alphabetic ordering does not
provide as robust a signal as the classical oddball paradigm in this
filtering method, it still retains some structure that
new classification methods could extract \cite{Hohne2014}.  

Previous experiments show that, to some degree, increasing the number
of selections presented in a trial decreases performance due to
informational masking \cite{Maddox2012a}. Therefore, in order to
create a high bit rate auditory speller paradigm, higher selections
must be added while minimizing the factors of increased trial time
and informational masking.

%TODO are there other studies that segregate letters based on simi?
%\cite{Schreuder2010a,Schreuder2011,Hohne2011a}. 
%Although the P300 response is deemed the oddball response because stimuli are
%unexpected, the sequential and predictable letters in this paradigm
%do in fact produce a classifiable brain response 


This experiment tests the effects of alphabetic ordering, the
effects of phonemic similarities in letters, and the effects
of dynamic vs. ordered selections.  In particular we explore
which of these features determine a listener's ability to
discriminate target selections, how these features correlate
with cognitive load, and the ability to corroborate 
perceived cognitive load with pupillometry data.  Cognitive load is
assessed objectively via pupillometry which is a corollary of
the attention and brain activation in a
task\cite{Zekveld2014}, as well as a
subjective assessment using the NASA Task Load Index survey
that measures perceived workload \cite{Zickler2013a}.  The
conditions test the usability of some of the new features
incorporated into modern auditory BCI systems which are
generally added with the assumption, but without the scientific
confirmation, that they aid usability.    

\paragraph{Question}

With new devices, designs, and strategies, how do we relate
findings in bit rate to those related to usability?  The
objective of this study is twofold.  One aim is to assess
different auditory paradigms using three available measures:
the accuracy in hearing a target letter which objectively
tests a subjects ability to do the task,  pupil sizes which
objectively tests cognitive load, and the NASA Task Load
Index, a survey which test cognitive load subjectively.  The
second aim is to examine the effectiveness of these three
measures in discriminating cognitive load or accuracy between
possible paradigms for future studies.

%The major aspects can be separated into:
%1) developing the human computer interaction component assessing the
%psychophysics limitations of current auditory BCI systems and 2)
%assessing the generalized objective and subjective assessment of
%cognitive load in users of a BCI paradigm.

      ordering is retained throughout the trial.  In the random
      condition, letters are also assigned to displace similar letters
      but the letter sequence within a group changes sequence
      after each cycle of the trial.}

\section{Methods}

Thirteen subjects took part in this experiment.  All subjects were
native English speakers with no hearing difficulties.  Participants
had pure-tone threshold in both ears within 20 dB of normal-hearing
thresholds at octave frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz.  All
subjects gave informed consent to participate in the study as
overseen by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

Stimuli consisted of all letters of the alphabet plus the
additional commands of 'Pause', 'Space', 'Read', and 'Delete'
for a total of thirty selections.  These four commands were
always placed in the right spatial group regardless of trial
condition.  The selections were spoken recordings of two
similar sounding male speakers.  These selections were divided
by virtual spatial location into three groups (left, middle,
and right) as shown in Figure \ref{screenshot}.  These
selections were monotonized using Praat software and processed
with pseudo-anechoic head-related transfer functions (recorded
from a KEMAR manikin at 1 m).  All selections were trimmed to
410 ms in length.  All stimuli were generated at a
sampling rate of 24414 Hz and sent to Tucker-Davis
Technologies hardware for digital-to-analog conversion and
attenuation, and then presented over in-ear headphones
(Etymotic Research ER-2).

Stimuli fell into three conditions alphabetic, fixed-order,
and random.  The three conditions were chosen to isolate a
feature of auditory spellers that may have an effect on
cognitive load.  The ordering and spatial distribution of
letters varied by condition as explained in Table
\ref{conditionTable}.  In the alphabetic condition, letters
were assigned a spatial location in alphabetic order.  The
alphabetic ordering was chosen since it is generally intuitive
and engrained in native English speakers.  This condition
also closely matches the charStreamer paradigm proposed by
Hohne et al.  2014\cite{Hohne2014}.  In the fixed-order
condition, letters were assigned to a spatial location so as to
separate phonemically similar letters.  Throughout the trial
of this condition, the ordering of the letters remained
constant.  In the random condition, similar letters were
distributed in the same way as the fixed-order condition only
throughout the trial, the ordering of the letters changed,
meaning subjects had no cue as to when the target letter would
occur. 

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{2screenshot}
  \caption{ An example of the visual primer shown before each
      trial.  This primer depicts the phonemically displaced
      letter ordering characteristic of the primers of the
      fixed-order condition and the random condition. The three circles
      represent the three spatial letter groups or streams of the trial.  The
      target letter is highlighted in green, so in this trial
      the subject will listen for D in all letters appearing to come
      from straight ahead.  The clockwise
      sequence of the letters (first letter at the bottom)
      indicates the sequence the selections will be spoken in
  during any given cycle.  Note that the original sequence of
  letters within a spatial group displayed in the visual primer is only
  retained past the first cycle in the alphabetic
  and fixed-order conditions. In the random condition, all
  letters will stay in the same spatial location but the
  sequence will change.}
  \label{screenshot}
\end{figure}

The three circles in the example visual primer (Figure
\ref{screenshot}), represent the three spatial groups of a trial.
Each group has ten selections and a virtual location.  The selections
within a group were spoken sequentially with a 450 ms lag
between letters.  The complete recitation of all letters in
the group lasted 4.5 s and was termed a cycle.  The task in a trial
consisted of five repeated cycles. Subjects were informed to
only listen to the target spatial location group for the
trial, and were expected to ignore the other two groups at the
different locations which played simultaneously. Since all
three groups were simultaneous, all thirty selections were
presented to the subject every 4.5 s, but by selectively
attending the target group, they only attended the recitation
of ten selections. All the groups were asynchronized from the
two others by 150 ms such that no letters in separate groups
would ever have coinciding onsets during a trial.
%TODO to bin the targets into separate cycles 

The time course of a trial is diagrammed in Figure \ref{trialtrace}.
Each trial contained the visual priming period for the first seven seconds.
During this priming period, the spatial locations of the letters
were displayed (Figure \ref{screenshot}).  The target letter was highlighted in
green and also spoken at its respective location so that the
listener knew before the trial began which spatial group location to
listen to for the entirety of the trial. At 7 s, the visual
primer disappeared and subjects began fixation on a small (~5 mm
diameter) white dot at the center of the screen for the remainder of
the trial.  The task lasted from 13 s, when the spoken letters
began, to 36 s, the end of the trial.  Between each trial there was a rest
period with no visual, or auditory stimuli besides the background
white noise.  In this period, the screen retained the same luminance
as during the trial but without a fixation dot. This baseline period
lasted 2 s.  All pupil data was baseline-corrected by
subtracting all samples of the trial by the average value during
this baseline period.  This corrected the subject's global drifts in pupil
size over the course of the experiment.  All pupil data is thus in relative arbitrary units
(AU) since the data processing strategy emphasized relative
changes in pupil size.  The raw pupillometry values were proportional
to the number of pixels of the pupil in the infrared recordings.
Approximately half of all trials contained two targets, the other
half, one. To test the listener's raw ability to discriminate letters
among the conditions, subjects were prompted at the end of each
trial to enter the target occurrences, one or two. Each cycle either
contained the target letter or the target was substituted with
another letter from within the same spatial group location.

The experiment consisted of 27 trials per condition
with 9 trials at each spatial location.  The experiment
lasted last less than 2 h with breaks.   For each
subject all 27 trials per condition were averaged for accuracy
and pupil size.  From these values for all subjects, the across-subject mean and
standard errors were computed.  In calculating pupillometry
means, only the second (17.5 s) through fourth cycle (31 s) of
the task window were counted since the fixed-order and random
conditions were only distinguishable after the first cycle
when the letter sequence changed.

To assess the subject's experience of cognitive load subjectively,
the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was performed after completion
of the experiment\cite{Zickler2013a}.  The survey consisted of two
sections which subjects completed separately for each
condition.  The first section of the survey prompted subjects
to rate the condition's difficulty from 1 to 9 on 6 factors:
mental demand, performance-based demand, effort-based demand,
temporal demand, frustration, and physical demand. In the
second section, subjects were given pairs of these factor
titles and asked to choose which was the more important
contributor to their experience of workload.  From these
comparisons, a weighting was computed for each factor.
Written responses were not elicited during the survey section,
however, subjects were made aware that comments they made
regarding the subject may be recorded and used.

%One subject communicated that they had 
%misunderstood the task directions by listening at all locations for
%the letter after completing the experiment.  This subject
%was removed from the data set. 

%All distributions were assumed to be normal for significance testing
%with the Pearson correlation coefficient and the paired t-test.

\section{Results}

We set the criterion to be p<.05 in order to reject the null
hypothesis that the across-subject means were equal. P-values
below this threshold were deemed significant. All statistics
are reported as the across-subject mean for each condition $\pm$
the standard error of the mean shown as ($\pm$ SEM).  Unless otherwise
noted, all pupillometry data was baseline corrected 
by the baseline period proceeding the respective trial.

  correlation though not significant.}
\end{figure}

No significant difference was found for subjects ability to
discriminate the target letter among the three conditions.
The across-subject mean accuracy for the alphabetic, fixed-order, and random
condition were $83.8 \% (\pm2.1)$, $87.9 \% (\pm3.3)$,
and $83.6 \% (\pm 2.9)$ respectively.  The two-tailed paired t-testing among 
the alphabetic and fixed-order condition yielded a p-value of .15,
among alphabetic and random .96, and between fixed-order and
random .13.  None of the conditions met the p<.05 criterion needed
to reject the null hypothesis, that means across the conditions had
equal accuracies. These results are summarized in Figure \ref{accuracy}.
There was also no significant difference between the accuracy
in the first three blocks and last three blocks of the
experiment that might indicate a learning curve.

\subsection{Physiological}

The results for the mean pupil size are summarized in Figure
\ref{psBarplot}. The time course of pupil dynamics is shown in
Figure \ref{trialtrace}.  All mean values reported are mean
values of the
task window (13 - 36 s) of the trial.  The across-subject means for the
baseline-corrected pupil responses ($\pm$ standard error of
the subject mean) was $ 302.73 (\pm 0.48)$, $400.52 (\pm
.60)$, and $179.91 (\pm 0.73)$ for the alphabetic,
fixed-order, and random conditions respectively.  The
significance of the paired t-test yielded 0.21 for alphabetic
and fixed-order, 0.23 for alphabetic and random, and 0.03 for
fixed-order and random conditions.

When we instead look at the time windows around targets, the
distinction between the random and fixed-order is also strong.
Taking the mean of the window from the target letter onset to
2.5 s later yields values of $338.26 (\pm 0.88)$, $413.33 (\pm
0.80)$, and $215.50 (\pm 0.88)$ for the alphabetic,
fixed-order, and random conditions respectively.  Comparing
p-values yields 0.26 for the alphabetic and fixed-order, 0.24
for the alphabetic and random, and 0.04 for the fixed-order
and random conditions.  We consider the difference in peaks
between at fixed-order and random to be significant.

Taking the maximum value within the target window 
yielded  values of $429.04 (\pm 151.54)$, $510.41 (\pm
142.66)$, and $322.75 (\pm 130.23)$ for the alphabetic,
fixed-order, and random conditions respectively.  The cross
condition p-values were 0.26 for alphabetic and fixed-order,
0.32 for alphabetic and random, and 0.05 for fixed-order and
random conditions which we also consider to be significant.

However the significance of this difference disappears when we
instead look only at the local maximum value within the target window.
These values are calculated via the across-subject maximum values subtracted
by the mean pupil size for that condition.  This measure
gives a sense of how much the pupil size changes with respect
to the rest of the task condition. The means were $90.78 (\pm
13.72)$, $97.08 (\pm 12.94)$, and $107.25 (\pm 14.30)$ for the
alphabetic, fixed-order, and random conditions respectively.
The cross condition p-values were 0.68 for alphabetic and
fixed-order, 0.30 for alphabetic and random, and 0.29 for
fixed-order and random conditions.  None of these differences
are significant.

\subsection{Subjective}

The NASA task load index survey yielded contrasting results
than those suggested by the pupillometry data.  The weighted
score for alphabetic, fixed-order, and random conditions were
$21.53 (\pm 0.44)$, $22.27 (\pm 0.46)$, $22.83 (\pm 0.42)$
respectively.

Paired t-test p-values between the alphabetic and fixed-order was
.04, between alphabetic and random .005, and between fixed-order
and random .07.  These results are summarized in Figure
\ref{cogLoad}.  Thus the cognitive load in alphabetic condition was
rated significantly less demanding than both the fixed-order and
random trials.

\subsection{Cross-measure correlation} 
When the three measures
(accuracy in hearing the target letter, pupil size, and the NASA TLX
cognitive load survey) were tested for significance of Pearson's
correlation, no measures were significantly correlated.  However,
the correlations between pupil size for the task period and the
survey were high.  Between pupillometry and the survey measures,
the alphabetic condition had a p-value of 0.09, between the
fixed-order 0.08, and between random .31.  All other comparisons
for each condition among the three measures of accuracy, pupillometry, and survey
yielded non-significant p-values above .10.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

\subsection{Behavioral}

No significant effects were found between condition types for
the measure of accuracy, or the correlation of this measure
with the others.  Accuracy in discriminating the target was
the only measure relating the different conditions to their
projected bit rate in an auditory speller paradigm, since, if
a subject can not hear their desired letter, it would be
unlikely that a classifier would still register the letter.
From this respect, the type of task in the experiment did not
show a significant effect on the potential bit rate of these
systems. This means that from our findings, we can only weigh
in on the major effects of these different auditory design
strategies in terms of usability or perceived task load. Since
the verification of accuracy introduces a new task outside of
the paradigm being tested, and it still did not show
significant effects, it would be more effective for future
studies assessing cognitive load in auditory BCI paradigms to
test the accuracy of classification directly in a real speller
setting via classification of the EEG recorded P300 signals.

\subsection{Physiological}

Although the pupillometry difference between the fixed-order
and alphabetic condition was significant ($p<.03$), the spread
did not distinguish the alphabetic condition from the others.
Inability to resolve these conditions may be because the pupil
dynamic range for each subject was not recorded in a formal
way. Inability to normalize subject pupil sizes means that
individuals with a large range may have been given
artificially higher weighting in the calculation of the grand
mean as can be seen in the subject means shown in Figure
\ref{psBarplot}.

%TODO cite a study here ideally
The different findings between the pupillometry and survey measure
highlights the distinction between sustained attention and
mental processing and what both imply for perceived cognitive
load.  Although sustained attention may be perceived as
difficult, the actual cognitive processing involved in such a
task may be suppressed.
If we consider the pupil size to be proportional to mental
activity, the difference between pupil size for the random and
fixed-order condition may be explainable.  For example, the
random condition provides no information to the listener about
the occurrence of the letter other than its spatial location;
the subject likely only passively listens for the
entire trial.  In the alphabetic condition,
subjects may have been mostly passive listeners with some minor mental activity
related to recalling and checking the ordering around the target.
However, in the fixed-order condition,
an entirely new ordering was assigned. Given that
a subject is incentivized to memorize a new letter ordering
(see subjective results and discussion), the fixed-order
condition eliciting the highest relative pupil size 
is likely due to the mental processing involved
in learning and using a new ordering during the trial.  

Since subjects were made aware at the start of the experiment
that they would be scoring the relative difficulty of the
three conditions, some may have assumed the additional
implicit task of distinguishing the fixed-order and random
conditions. These conditions can only be discriminated during
the trial and not by their visual primer.  This interpretation
is corroborated by one subject who reported that it was easier
not to consider which trial was of which condition type and
instead just listen for the letter.  Although, consciously
ignoring the conditions does not necessarily mean that task
difficulty or accuracy among the conditions is equal (this
subject rated all conditions equally in the survey but had
differences in accuracy and pupil size between the three
conditions).  If subject's were assuming this to be an
additional task, it would peak then resolve in the second
cycle of the task period since this is when the sequence
changes in the random condition.  If we examine the trace of
the fixed-order and random condition we do see a peak in the
second cycle which devolves thereafter.

The mean trace shows a steady ramp down
during the task period for each condition.  Some of this may be due
the more immediate decrease in the random and fixed-order
trace after resolving the task of condition discrimination in
the second cycle. This may also be because, although the
probability of having a target is symmetric about the entirety
of the task period of the trial (13 - 36 s), subjects know
that there will be at most two targets.  In about 50\% of all
trials of the experiment, the trial contain two targets. This
means that in those trials with two targets, that when the
second target occurs, the subject will likely stop performing
the task.  Note that in the period before the task begins,
although subjects are exposed to the same fixation dot, the
mean pupil size is significantly lower than the task mean.
Having the possibility of up to 5 targets (one during each
cycle with no replacements) may be a more effective strategy
for assessing steady state load because it ensures that all
subjects are performing the task for the entirety of the
trial.

\subsection{Subjective}

In light of the lack of significant findings in the other
separate measures and the high correlations with the
pupillometry data, we take the subjective survey results as
the ground truth for the relative difficulty of each
condition.  The subjective results indicate that ordering has
the largest effect on perceived work load. Despite fixed-order
having maximally displaced phonemically similar letters, it
was still scored as significantly harder than the known
alphabetic condition.  In addition, the random condition was
rated more difficult than the alphabetic ordering, indicating
that there was incentive for familiarizing oneself with the
fixed-order ordering throughout the trial and/or experiment
such that one could use the order as an informative cue.
Since there is an incentive to learn the fixed-order
condition, it is likely that that the difference in difficulty
reported in the survey is due to the added mental activity of
learning the new ordering throughout the experiment. It is
therefore unclear whether this difference would persist over
multiple days or trials or if the workload would decrease
below alphabetic level due to less difficulty discriminating
similar letters.  From these findings we can conclude that,
with no learning, the alphabetic ordering paradigms such as
the charStreamer paradigm offers a potential to greatly
increase the usability of current speller systems.  However,
while alphabetic ordering might be the best design to suit the
population in general, one subject commented that
discriminating similar sounding letters was difficult and the
subject means for the measures of pupillometry and the survey
show there was still some clear dissension among the conditions. 

One complication to note is that in the random condition the
letters were distributed into the three spatial group
locations such that similar sounding letters were, as much as
possible, put into different groups. When multiple letters had
to be put into the same spatial group location they were
sequenced so as not to be spoken contiguously.  As an example
in Figure \ref{screenshot}, B and E must be in the left
spatial location but they are placed such that they are not
spoken sequentially to avoid confusion.  This holds in the
fixed-order condition, however in the random location, some
similar letters will occasionally inevitably be spoken contiguously since
the letters within the locations change between cycles.
Although the subject could not use timing cues in the
random condition, adjacent similar letters may not have made a substantial
difference in the outcome. 

%TODO ross's article
Although no written responses were elicited, one subject
commented that looking ahead while the letter was at a
different location such as left or right was more difficult.
The feature of requiring subjects to look at the center of the
screen was an arbitrary additional cognitive task that while
was a necessity in the experiment would not necessarily exist
in the end-user application settings of an auditory speller
device.

\subsection{Cross-measure correlation}

These findings suggest that having a known ordering plays the
largest role in the task difficulty of an auditory speller
paradigm.  While accuracy in discriminating selections
provides a strong ground truth for projected bit rate, it does
not provide across-subject differences nor is it correlated
with the other measures of cognitive load used in the study.
For these reasons, ability to discriminate a task (i.e.
accuracy) is rejected as a useful measure of usability.  To
formally assess a new device or paradigm, we suggest future
studies to include a battery of three measures: bit-rate of
the online system, pupillometry, and the NASA TLX survey.
The pupillometry data suggests that the population level
mental activity may be higher than the perceived workload for
a task.  The high levels of correlation between pupillometry
and subjective survey speaks to the strength of both measures
in assessing the cognitive load in a task for individuals.
For the small population of individuals with unique clinical
concerns who rely on these systems, it may be more appropriate
to focus on methods that test usability on an individual level
as opposed to the on a population level.  These methods may
serve as a heuristic for judging what type of system might be
more usable for an individual.
