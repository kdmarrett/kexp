This is the information sheet for the cognitive load survey.

You will be answering questions on three condition types you were
tested on.

The order of the blocks in the survey is:
1. Alphabetic ordering 
2. Random, constant ordering
3. Random, changing ordering

Below are the terms defined for reference during the experiment. Give
your best responses to the questions given these definitions.

Mental Demand:
How much mental and perceptual activity was required (e.g. thinking,
deciding, remembering, looking, searching)? Was the task easy or
demanding, simple or  complex, exacting or forgiving?

Physical Demand:
How much physical activity was required (e.g. pushing, pulling, turning,
controlling, activating)?  Was the task easy or demanding, slow or
brisk, slack or strenuous, restful or laborious? 

Temporal Demand:
How much time pressure did you feel to keep up with the rate or pace at
which the task or task elements occurred? Was the pace slow and
leisurely or rapid and frantic? 

Performance-based Demand:
How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goals of the
task set by the experimenter (or yourself)? How satisfied were you
with your performance in accomplishing these goals?

Effort-based Demand
How hard did you have to work overall (both mentally and physically) to
accomplish your level of performance?

Frustration-based Demand:
How insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed and annoyed versus
secure, gratified, content, relaxed and complacent did you feel
