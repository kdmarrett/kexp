# SCRIPT PROMPTS
Will be prompted to enter subject # (sequential kexp subject #) and
session number (always 1)

# EXPERIMENT TYPE/EQUIPMENT
Pupillometry: chin rest, pupillometry computer, etc.
Behavioral: keyboard

# APPROXIMATE RUN TIME
1.5 - 2 hours.

# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
Stimuli has already been generated for all subjects so the run script is
all that is needed for each subject.  Depending on subject's height,
they might want to sit on cushy stool or in big comfy chair (but
sometimes helps to give more height by putting big blue blanket under
them)

In this condition, letters are assigned a spatial location in alphabetic
order.  You can use the unique speaker and location to help you listen
for each occurrence of the target letter. 

In this condition, letters are assigned a spatial location in a random
order.  Throughout the trial, the ordering of the letters will remain
constant.  You can use the unique speaker and location to help you
listen for each occurrence of' the target letter in this condition.

In this condition, letters are assigned a spatial location in a random
order.  Throughout the trial, the ordering of the letters will change
meaning you will not know when the target letter will occur. You can
use the unique speaker and location to help you listen for each
occurrence of the target letter in this condition.

You need to place your chin on this chin rest during the experiment and
watch the screen. The chin rest is being used to keep your eye steady to
record pupil data during the experiment.

Each trial in this experiment will begin with a visual representation.
In these visual representations, you will notice that one of the letters
is colored green and spoken, this is the target letter for the trial.
Count the occurrences of this target letter during the trial.  Press
button 1 if only one occurence of the target letter occurred in the
trial and 2 if there were two.  After the visual representation, a small
fixation dot will appear in the center of screen. Keep your eyes fixated
on this dot for as long as it remains visible.
There will also be written instructions on the screen that walk you
through this. Press any key to get you to the next screen of
instructions.  Some conditions will be easy while others may be hard.
Please don't give up though; listen carefully and make your best guess
for each trial.  It's important to press the buttons you intend to
press, so I suggest you just keep your index finger on 1, middle
finger on 2, and always make your button presses with those fingers.
This keyboard is here to insure you don't shift your fingers off of
those buttons.  There will be a few training trials where you can
practice the task. You'll get feedback whether or not you are giving
the correct answers.  The experiment is split into three sections.
In this first section you will be introduced to the conditions then
complete training.  After you get through the training, the real
experiment will start in Section 2 where there won't be any more
feedback. The experiment will be in blocks and you'll have the
opportunity to rest your eyes or get up and take a break if you'd
like in between any of the blocks. At the end of the second section,
the instructions will tell you to get up and come outside the booth
for a mandatory break. At that time, we will tell you the final
instructions for the last section of the experiment.  If you
need to tell us something or have a question or an issue and
don't want to take out your earbuds or come outside the booth,
just press this button (show). Any questions?

# Section 3 Spiel
In this last section, you will be presented with 1 trial from each
condition type then asked several questions about its difficulty.  We
are interested in your experience with the particular condition. In the
most general sense, we are examining the 'workload' you experienced. The
factors that influence your experience of workload may come from the
task itself, your feelings about your own performance, how much effort
you put in, or any frustration you felt. Because workload may be caused
by any of these factors, we would like you to evaluate several of them.

After performing the task for each condition, you will be asked to rate
your experience from 1 to 9 for several factors. Please consider each
rating scale and condition type separately when answering the questions.
Please read the descriptions of the set of six scales carefully.  

Throughout this section, the rating scales are used to assess your
experiences in the different task conditions. People interpret these
scales in individual ways. For example, some people feel that mental or
temporal demands are the essential aspects of workload regardless of the
effort they expended on a given task or the level of performance they
achieved.  The evaluation you are about to perform is a technique to
assess the relative importance of six factors in determining how much
workload you experienced.

Afterwards, you will be presented with a series of pairs of rating scale titles (for 
example Effort versus Mental Demands) and asked to choose which of the items was more 
important to your experience of workload. 
Press the number corresponding to the scale title that represents the more important contributor to workload. 
Remember, you are rating the relative difficulty 
of the task only for the task of the
 condition that you just heard independently of the other conditions.
Please consider your choices carefully and make them consistent with how you used the rating scales
during the particular task you were asked to evaluate. There is no correct pattern -- we 
are only interested in your opinion. If you need
to tell us something or have a question or an issue and don't want to
take out your earbuds or come outside the booth, just press this button
(show). Any questions?


# CODE
Location Behavioural Tower C:\Experiments\1v1a\1v1aExp\' beh1v1a_2IFC:
the main experimental loop that sets up the experiment, saves data, and
runs all the other subfunctions.  stimuliMaker: generates all the
stimuli for experiment and saves them in stimuli envNoiseMaker: used by
stimuli maker to create noise envelopes for exp II and their orthogonal
complements.  intervalMaker: takes trialCodes and pulls stimuli from
stimuli files to create experimental trials presentTrial1v1a: takes
intervalMakers auditory stim and circle diameter modulation and actually
runs the audiovisual animation and then takes the participants response.
training1v1a: practice before beginning main trials.  preThresh1v1a:
roughly finds threshold of participants on a static circle, so that main
experiment will start close to their threshold.  dataAnalysis1v1a: plots
the results of a subject.

# TASK
kexp: Determine the number of target letter presented in a trial 1 or 2.

27 experimental trials per condition, 3 conditions

# STIMULI
The auditory stimuli consisted of the target letter spoken followed by 
silence then 5 cycles of the repeated alphabet plus a few commands.
In 1 or 2 of these 5 cycles a target letter occurred. The visual
stimuli draws all possible letters with their relative spatial location.
The target letter is highlighted green.  Subjects are given,
green, and red feedback to their input during training.


# EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS/DATA ORGANIZATION
Data Location: Location Behavioural Tower C:\Experiments\1v1a\Data Each
full experiment will have two files associated with it
exp_1bindDet_1v1a_subj...  exp_2bindDet_1v1a_subj...

In each of these is a response record file which is a fail safe with all
the response, trial codes, and stim level on all trials.  and there is
UD which is the collection of all the adaptive tracks there will be 7 of
them.

exp 1. Adaptive tracks correspond in order to the discs modulations 1. 0
Hz (circle AM), 2. 3 Hz, 3. 5 Hz, 4. 6 Hz, 5. 6 Hz pi/2 (phase shift),
6. 6 Hz pi, 7. 6 Hz 3*pi/2

exp 2. Adaptive tracks correspond in order to the discs modulations 1.
