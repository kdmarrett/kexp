# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
Stimuli has already been generated for all subjects so the run script is
all that is needed for each subject.  Depending on subject's height,
they might want to sit on cushy stool or in big comfy chair (but
sometimes helps to give more height by putting big blue blanket under
them)

# SECTION 1 AND 2 SPIEL
You need to place your chin on this chin rest during the experiment and
watch the screen. The chin rest is being used to keep your eye steady
to record pupil data during the experiment.


Your job is to count the occurences of the target letter during the
trial.  Press button 1 if only one occurence of the target letter
occurred in the trial and 2 if there were two.
There will also be written
instructions on the screen that walk you through this. Press any key to
get you to the next screen of instructions.  Some conditions will be
easy while others may be hard.  Please
don't give up though; listen carefully and make your best guess for
each trial.
It's important to press the buttons you intend to press, so I
suggest you just keep your index finger on 1, middle finger on 2,
and always make your button presses with those fingers.
This keyboard is here to insure you don't shift your fingers off of those
buttons.  There will be a few training trials where you can practice
the task. You'll get feedback whether or not you are giving the correct
answers. 
The experiment is split into three sections.  In this first section you
will be introduced to the conditions then complete training.  
After you get through the training, the real experiment will
start in Section 2 where there won't be any more feedback. The experiment will be
in blocks and you'll have the opportunity to rest your eyes or get up
and take a break if you'd like in between any of the blocks. At the end
of the second section, the instructions will tell you to get up and
come outside the booth for a mandatory break. At that time, we will tell
you the final instructions for the last section of the experiment.  
If you need to tell us
something or have a question or an issue and don't want to take out your
earbuds or come outside the booth, just press this button (show). Any
questions?

# CODE
Location Behavioural Tower C:\Experiments\1v1a\1v1aExp\' beh1v1a_2IFC:
the main experimental loop that sets up the experiment, saves data, and
runs all the other subfunctions.  stimuliMaker: generates all the
stimuli for experiment and saves them in stimuli envNoiseMaker: used by
stimuli maker to create noise envelopes for exp II and their orthogonal
complements.  intervalMaker: takes trialCodes and pulls stimuli from
stimuli files to create experimental trials presentTrial1v1a: takes
intervalMakers auditory stim and circle diameter modulation and actually
runs the audiovisual animation and then takes the participants response.
training1v1a: practice before beginning main trials.  preThresh1v1a:
roughly finds threshold of participants on a static circle, so that main
experiment will start close to their threshold.  dataAnalysis1v1a: plots
the results of a subject.

# TASK
2IFC: Determine whether the signal was present in the first or the
second interval (1st or 2nd choice). Also respond at any time if the
circle briefly changes color (3rd choice) (in order to maintain visual
attention).

27 experimental trials per condition, 3 conditions

# STIMULI
The auditory target was a 400 Hz tone of 2 second duration, whose
amplitude varied sinusoidally at 6 Hz. Auditory masker was white noise.
Each began and ended with a 10 ms cosine ramp.  The visual stimuli was a
white ring around a grey disc whose diameter dynamically varied. All
stimuli were presented diotically. 


# EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS/DATA ORGANIZATION
Data Location: Location Behavioural Tower C:\Experiments\1v1a\Data Each
full experiment will have two files associated with it
exp_1bindDet_1v1a_subj...  exp_2bindDet_1v1a_subj...

In each of these is a response record file which is a fail safe with all
the response, trial codes, and stim level on all trials.  and there is
UD which is the collection of all the adaptive tracks there will be 7 of
them.

exp 1. Adaptive tracks correspond in order to the discs modulations 1. 0
Hz (circle AM), 2. 3 Hz, 3. 5 Hz, 4. 6 Hz, 5. 6 Hz pi/2 (phase shift),
6. 6 Hz pi, 7. 6 Hz 3*pi/2

exp 2. Adaptive tracks correspond in order to the discs modulations 1.
coherent, 2. orthogonal, 3. V0, 4. coherent +41.6 (audio precedes video)
5. coherent +125 , 6. coherent -41.6 (video precedes audio ), 7.
coherent -125
