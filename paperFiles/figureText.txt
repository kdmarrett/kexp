Barplots show the average subject mean for the first 9 trials vs.
the last 9 trials for each condition and the survey results.  
a) Behavioral: Shows the
initial and final mean accuracy among conditions.  The accuracy
test subjects ability to discriminate the number of targets in a
trial as means to verify attention during the task period.
There were no significant differences between conditions among
any conditions.  There were also no significant differences
between accuracies between initial and final trials.

b) Physiological: Shows the mean base corrected subject pupil
size for each subject in each condition in initial and final
trials. Higher pupil size indicates larger cognitive load.
Fixed-order is significantly greater than Alphabetic and Random
in early trials (p=.04, p=.02 respectively). The initial
Fixed-order mean was also significantly higher than during the
final trials (p<.03).
During the final trials, no conditions were significantly
discriminable.

c) Survey: shows the indicated weighted difficulty according to the NASA
TLX. Subjects rated the random condition significantly harder
than both the Fixed-order and Alphabetic condition (p<.04,
p=.0005 respectively).  The greater difficulty of Fixed-order vs.
Alphabetic was not significant (p=.07).

Pupillometry time series: 

Shows the mean subject pupillometry size throughout the course of
a trial. A trial is segregated broadly into the primer period, No
target occured where subjects learn the target letter and adjust
to the ordering of the trial, followed by a period where subjects
fixate on a white dot on the screen before the task sound begins,
followed by the task period. During the task period shown, cycles
are separated with dotted lines. In the first cycle, no target
occured and Fixed-order and Random conditions are indiscriminable
so it is not considered as part of the task during analysis.
Analyzed separately, no significant differences exist between
conditions in the primer portion, fixation portion, or first
cycle of the trial as one would expect.  The resulting means from
the initial and final task periods are shown in Figure 2b.


Methods
13 subjects took part in this experiment.  All subjects were
native English speakers with no hearing difficulties.  Participants
had pure-tone threshold in both ears within 20 dB of normal-hearing
thresholds at octave frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz.  All
subjects gave informed consent to participate in the study as
overseen by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

Stimuli consisted of all letters of the alphabet plus the
additional commands of 'Pause', 'Space', 'Read', and 'Delete'
for a total of thirty selections.  These selections were divided
by virtual spatial location into three groups (left, middle,
and right) as shown in Figure \ref{screenshot}.  These
selections were monotonized using Praat software and processed
with pseudo-anechoic head-related transfer functions (recorded
from a KEMAR manikin at 1 m).  All selections were trimmed to
410 ms in length.  All stimuli were generated at a
sampling rate of 24414 Hz and sent to Tucker-Davis
Technologies hardware for digital-to-analog conversion and
attenuation, and then presented over in-ear headphones
(Etymotic Research ER-2).

Stimuli fell into three conditions alphabetic, fixed-order,
and random.  The three conditions were chosen to isolate a
feature of auditory spellers that may have an effect on
cognitive load.  The ordering and spatial distribution of
letters varied by condition as explained in Table
\ref{conditionTable}.  The alphabetic condition
closely matches the charStreamer paradigm proposed by
Hohne et al.  2014\cite{Hohne2014}.  In the fixed-order
condition, letters were assigned to a spatial location so as to
separate phonemically similar letters.  Throughout the trial
of this condition, the ordering of the letters remained
constant.  In the random condition, similar letters were
distributed in the same way as the fixed-order condition only
throughout the trial, the ordering of the letters changed,
meaning subjects had no cue as to when the target letter would
occur.

  \caption{ An example of the visual primer shown before each
      trial.  This primer depicts the phonemically displaced
      letter ordering characteristic of the primers of the
      fixed-order condition and the random condition. The three circles
      represent the three spatial letter groups or streams of the trial.  The
      target letter is highlighted in green, so in this trial
      the subject will listen for D in all letters appearing to come
      from straight ahead.  The clockwise
      sequence of the letters (first letter at the bottom)
      indicates the sequence the selections will be spoken in
  during any given cycle.  Note that the original sequence of
  letters within a spatial group displayed in the visual primer is only
  retained past the first cycle in the alphabetic
  and fixed-order conditions. In the random condition, all
  letters will stay in the same spatial location but the
  sequence will change.}

The three circles in the example visual primer (Figure
\ref{screenshot}), represent the three spatial groups of a trial.
Each group has ten selections and a virtual location.  

%combine with figure text
The selections
within a group were spoken sequentially with a 450 ms lag
between letters.  The complete recitation of all letters in
the group lasted 4.5 s and was termed a cycle.  The task in a trial
consisted of five repeated cycles. Subjects were informed to
only listen to the target spatial location group for the
trial, and were expected to ignore the other two groups at the
different locations which played simultaneously. Since all
three groups were simultaneous, all thirty selections were
presented to the subject every 4.5 s, but by selectively
attending the target group, they only attended the recitation
of ten selections. All the groups were asynchronized from the
two others by 150 ms such that no letters in separate groups
would ever have coinciding onsets during a trial.

The time course of a trial is diagrammed in Figure \ref{trialtrace}.
Each trial contained the visual priming period for the first seven seconds.
During this priming period, the spatial locations of the letters
were displayed (Figure \ref{screenshot}).  The target letter was highlighted in
green and also spoken at its respective location so that the
listener knew before the trial began which spatial group location to
listen to for the entirety of the trial. At 7 s, the visual
primer disappeared and subjects began fixation on a small (~5 mm
diameter) white dot at the center of the screen for the remainder of
the trial.  The task lasted from 13 s, when the spoken letters
began, to 36 s, the end of the trial.  Between each trial there was a rest
period with no visual, or auditory stimuli besides the background
white noise.  In this period, the screen retained the same luminance
as during the trial but without a fixation dot. This baseline period
lasted 2 s.  All pupil data was baseline-corrected by
subtracting all samples of the trial by the average value during
this baseline period.  This corrected the subject's global drifts in pupil
size over the course of the experiment.  All pupil data is thus in relative arbitrary units
(AU) since the data processing strategy emphasized relative
changes in pupil size.  The raw pupillometry values were proportional
to the number of pixels of the pupil in the infrared recordings.
Approximately half of all trials contained two targets, the other
half, one. To test the listener's raw ability to discriminate letters
among the conditions, subjects were prompted at the end of each
trial to enter the target occurrences, one or two. Each cycle either
contained the target letter or the target was substituted with
another letter from within the same spatial group location.

The experiment consisted of 27 trials per condition
with 9 trials at each spatial location.  The experiment
lasted last less than 2 h with breaks.   

%repeats figures text
In calculating pupillometry
means, only the second (17.5 s) through fourth cycle (31 s) of
the task window were counted since the fixed-order and random
conditions were only distinguishable after the first cycle
when the letter sequence changed.

To assess the subject's experience of cognitive load subjectively,
the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was performed after completion
of the experiment\cite{Zickler2013a}.  The survey consisted of two
sections which subjects completed separately for each
condition.  The first section of the survey prompted subjects
to rate the condition's difficulty from 1 to 9 on 6 factors:
mental demand, performance-based demand, effort-based demand,
temporal demand, frustration, and physical demand. In the
second section, subjects were given pairs of these factor
titles and asked to choose which was the more important
contributor to their experience of workload.  From these
comparisons, a weighting was computed for each factor.
Written responses were not elicited during the survey section,
however, subjects were made aware that comments they made
regarding the subject may be recorded and used.
