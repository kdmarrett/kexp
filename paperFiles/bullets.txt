lit review (past michael)

-Across all trials only Fixed-order and Random are significantly different

Cognitive load
-WWL is an example manner for weighting different factors used in
the original NASA TLX study

Cross-measure validation
-Survey and Pupillometry are particularly correlated
-Fixed-order higher correlations

Discussion points:
-Rudimentary target interval testing shows a significant
    difference in mean value and maximum value in the interval after
    a target in the fixed order case.  However, when the mean of the
    condition is subtracted these differences are no longer
    significant. This suggests that local changes in pupil size, as
    in the interval after a target, may not be as discriminative as
    global changes for a task.
